# Summary

This is the latest version of the MeArm V3.0. Nearly five years on from it's inception it is a much improved model.
Cut from 3mm material and using M2.5 screws. This now has a PCB in the base which makes it not quite so Maker friendly. I'll probably put together a design without that and with M3 parts, which are easier to source.
Available as ever from [mearm.com](http://mearm.com) and [Kitronik](http://kitronik.co.uk)

Shown here in lovely Walnut veneer, which is a bit of a pain to work with in robotics, but looks lovely.
