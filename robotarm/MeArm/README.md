# Robot arm at T400

Limited time and resources led to the decision to use the MeArm v3.0 for our T400 project during ASA3.

The files are located in this folder and sourced from [here](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3420797/files) and [here](https://github.com/mimeindustries/MeArm). The modification is the removal of the text for the lasercutting and shortend of some corners to fit on the base of the robot.

## Additional materials

Aside from the laser cut 3mm acrylic we need the following materials:

- 10x - M3 Nut
- 6x - M2.5 x 6mm
- 15x - M2.5 x 8mm
- 3x - M2.5 x 10mm
- 8x - M2.5 x 12mm
- 4x - M2.5 x 20mm

I'll give it a try on January 31st, 2020.
