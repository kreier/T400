Why Micropython? Because we teach python at school. It is used by data scientists. We use it in Jupyter notebooks. It is easier to learn than Arduino C.

And it has REPL - Read Evaluate Print. You get an immediate response. After flashing micropython v1.11 to my NodeMCU in five minutes the first blink from the commandline was working. Flipping pins without compiling and upload a program is GREAT!
